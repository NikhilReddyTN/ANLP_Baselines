# ANLP_Baselines

** For Running the models and baselines we used A100 GPU with 40 GB of GPU memory.
** Download Notebook to view it. It is not directly visible on GIT.


code/ANLP_static_compression.ipynb : Contains code for the model using static compression

code/ANLP_dynamic_compression.ipynb : Contains code for the model using three fixed threholds (low, mid, high)

code/ANLP_cosine_similarity.ipynb : Contains code for the model using cosine similarity to dynamically interpolate between a low and high compression thresholds

code/ANLP_Baseline.ipynb : Contains code for evaluating the baseline model on the DL19 dataset

code/ANLP_Baseline2.ipynb : Contains code for evaluating the baseline model on the DL20 dataset
